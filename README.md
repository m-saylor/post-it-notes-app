# Sanrio Post-It Notes App
This web application is a Sanrio-themed "post-it" style live notes app created with React, JS, SCSS, and a Firebase DB on the backend. Users can create notes, move them in 3 different planes, edit, delete, and clear them. The notes are draggable and have markdown support. Each note can be customized and coded with a different Sanrio character: Hello Kitty, Kuromi, My Melody, Pompompurin, and Keroppi. Each character code group has a different color scheme for the background, text, and accent colors. All of this data is stored and saved. The persistent storage and update of notes is hosted with Firebase. 

## Installation Instructions
You will need to run 'npm install' at the command line to install the necessary packages.

## How to Use
Enter a note title into the add note bar at the top of the screen to get started making notes.
Click the edit button to edit the title, image, or text of the note.
Click the move button to drag the note anywhere on the screen and move the note to the front.
Click the delete button to delete the note.
